It's a library developed & maintained by facebook. This library used to develop interactive SPA(Single page applications) & PWA's(Progressive web application). React is so popular now a days just because of it's simplicity, readability and also because of it's pure javascript(No template) concept. As it follow component based architecture and always be with DRY(Don't repeat yourself) principle helps to maintain the code base.
###### _Pros_ :
* Light Weight
* Fast because of vertual dom*
* Uses pure JS (JSX)
* Supports server side rendering
###### _Cons_ :
* State Managment is not good
* Multi route not support by default
* We have to rely on third party libraries which causes some issue in development

Angular is also follow component based approch but it also more likely be with MVT architecture.

###### _Pros_ :

* Support dependency injection, RxJS and services
###### _Cons_ :
* Bad performance because of it's UI rendering engine but it will gonna fix in Angular 9 with new Envy UI Engine
* We have to learn new JS Super set TypeScript but not a big deal
* Heavy Bundle slow loading
