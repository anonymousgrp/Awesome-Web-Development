#### Node.js
Node.js as a core is a javascript runtime outside the browser with combination of some javacsript libraries and also knows as modules. Node.js runtime build on top of Google V8 JavaScript Engine also known as Chrome's JavaScript Engine.
The main advantage of node.js is it's asynchronous and even driven approch gives wings to fly without blocking. As node.js is a single threaded system run on C++ UV Library.
There are many frameworks and library which helps to achieve things easier.

###### _Pros_ :
* Its built on JavaScript and has relatively small learning curve.
* Asynchronous nature (Event Loop)
* NPM modules: modules and libraries available for almost every possible scenario.
* Its data intensive, lightweight and perfect on distributed devices.
###### _Cons_ :
* Due to asynchronous nature, working on the logic is little complex.
* Not suitable for high computational programs.
* Poor Binary & Streams Support
* Dealing with relational database is a pain if you are using Node.
* Without diving in depth of JavaScript if someone starts Node, he may face conceptual problem.

##### Express
Express.js is a fast, non-opinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It is simply a technology built on Node.js which behaves like a middleware to help manage our servers and routes.
##### AdonisJS
AdonisJs has a support for an ORM is made with SQL-databases in mind (PostgreSQL). It creates efficient SQL-queries.
##### NestJs 
Nest uses progressive JavaScript and is written with TypeScript. Being built with TypeScript means that Nest comes with strong typing and combines elements of OOP(Object Oriented Programming).

#### Django
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Used by Instagram, BitBucket, Nasa Mozilla like big companies.

###### _Pros_ :
* Fast
* Fully Loaded with all essential like user authentication, administration, RSS Feed, Rest API Support & For Real Time Django Channels and much more things.
* Secure, insure all about security conserns like SQL Injection, Cross-Site scripting & csrf token and all.

###### _Cons_ :
* Django is too monolithic, high learning curve
* Everything is based on Django ORM
* Components get deployed together

#### Flask
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application micro framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks. Used by Netflix, Reddit, Lyft, Uber and other big companies.

###### _Pros_:
* Light Weight
* Beautiful Code
* Easy to use & Low Learnning Curve
###### _Cons_:
* Too much flexibility
* Limited on purpose
